## localization

  

for localization to make it easier we can use chat gpt just pass the Arabic and tell him in the prompt to make maps of translations of the given texts and and put the result in (Map <String  ,String> en ) for English and (Map <String  ,String> ar ) for arabic make it summarized and simple , don't write in arabic in any key in the map and check first if the value you need exists in the two maps in class `Translations`

lib/core/localizations/translations.dart` .

  

# please don't edit anything written

  

if you want to make any edit in shared widgets in core folder extend it only (make additions only as you wish).

  

any class or color that has prefix "my" is now edited to its name without the prefix my

  

app_strings : for string constants

app_text_styles : for common text styles

app_utils.dart : have some helpers constants like height = h , width = w, isTablet condition to check if the current device is Tablet to ensure responsiveness of your design

  

ensure that :

.flutter-plugins-dependencies

.flutter-plugins
  

are added to .gitignore

added
Planslist was moved to core/widgets because it is shared between 3 features (packages, profile - home view) and it will depend on a list of plans model which exists in core/models/plan_model.dart and using expansion widget instead of column for list tile it is more easier to use instead of column if you want to continue on styling the content of expansion widget you would be appreciated for doing so.
